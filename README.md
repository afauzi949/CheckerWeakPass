# Password Checker

Password checker is a tool that evaluates the strength and security of a password to ensure it meets specific security standards. This tool is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and enhancing data protection.

Main Features of a Password Checker:
1) Complexity Evaluation: It checks if the password includes a mix of characters such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
2) Length Verification: Assesses whether the password meets a minimum and, sometimes, maximum length requirement to prevent weak passwords.
3) Comparison Against Common Passwords: Determines if the password is too common or easy to guess by comparing it against databases of known weak passwords.
4) Feedback and Suggestions: Provides feedback on the password's strength and offers tips on how to make it stronger, such as recommending the inclusion of additional character types or a longer length.

By using a password checker, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches by ensuring their passwords are robust and secure.
